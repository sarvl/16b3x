16 bit cpu made entirely in vhdl 

details on architecture are in instruction_set.txt

both pipelined and not pipelined version seem to have no major bugs 
they are capable of running all programs in assembly/ 
most notably they can sort numbers and multiply matrixes 

unless bugs are found, for now this is done 


tu run the programs you can use ghdl and gtkwave
ive included gtkwave settings for each implementation

the assembler will be changed when i get back to compilers, right now dont judge
